herdsmen with cows - google art project.jpg|thumb|''herdsmen with cows'' (circa 1645), oil on canvas, 99 Ã 144 cm (39 Ã 57 in), [[dulwich picture gallery]]]] the development of aelbert cuyp, who was trained as a landscape painter, may be roughly sketched in three phases based on the painters who most influenced him during that time and the subsequent artistic characteristics that are apparent in his paintings. generally, cuyp learned tone from the exceptionally prolific [[jan van goyen]], light from [[jan both]] and form from his father, jacob gerritsz cuyp.reiss, p.8. cuypâs âvan goyen phaseâ can be placed approximately in the early 1640s. cuyp probably first encountered a painting by van goyen in 1640 when van goyen was, as stephen reiss points out âat the height of [his] powers.âibid., p. 8. this is noticeable in the comparison between two of cuypâs landscape paintings inscribed 1639 where no properly formed style is apparent and the landscape backgrounds he painted two years later for two of his fatherâs group portraits that are distinctly van goyenesque. cuyp took from van goyen the straw yellow and light brown tones that are so apparent in his dunes (1629) and the broken brush technique also very noticeable in that same work. this technique, a precursor to impressionism, is noted for the short brush strokes where the colors are not necessarily blended smoothly. in cuypâs river scene, two men conversing (1641) both of these van goyen-influenced stylistic elements are noticeable the next phase in the development of cuypâs increasingly amalgamated style is due to the influence of jan both. in the mid-1640s both, a native and resident of utrecht, had just returned to his hometown from a trip to rome. it is around this same time that cuypâs style changed fundamentally. in rome, both had developed a new style of composition due, at least in part, to his interaction with claude lorrain. this new style was focused on changing the direction of light in the painting. instead of the light being placed at right angles in relation to the line of vision, both started moving it to a diagonal position from the back of the picture.ibid., p. 8. in this new form of lighting, the artist (and viewer of the painting) faced the sun more or less contre-jour. both, and subsequently cuyp, used the advantages of this new lighting style to alter the sense of depth and luminosity possible in a painting. to make notice of these new capabilities, much use was made of elongated shadows. cuyp was one of the first dutch painters to appreciate this new leap forward in style and while his own both-inspired phase was quite short (limited to the mid-1640s) he did, more than any other contemporary dutch artist, maximize the full chromatic scale for sunsets and sunrises.ibid., p. 8. cuypâs third stylistic phase (which occurred throughout his career) is based on the influence of his father. while it is assumed that the younger cuyp did work with his father initially to develop rudimentary talents, aelbert became more focused on landscape paintings while jacob was a portrait painter by profession. as has been mentioned and as will be explained in depth below, there are pieces where aelbert provided the landscape background for his fatherâs portraits. what is meant by stating that aelbert learned form from his father is that his eventual transition from a specifically landscape painter to the involvement of foreground figures is attributed to his interaction with his father jacob. the evidence for aelbertâs evolution to foreground figure painter is in the production of some paintings from 1645-50 featuring foreground animals that do not fit with jacobâs style.ibid., p.9. adding to the confusion that is, aelbertâs stylistic development and the problem of attribution is of course the fact that jacobâs style was not stagnant either. their converging styles make it difficult to exactly understand the influences each had on the other, although it is clear enough to say that aelbert started representing large scale forms (something he had not done previously) and placing animals as the focus of his paintings (something that was specific to him).

contentious signatures added to historiansâ confusion as to who actually painted the works; and the collaborations and influences by different painters makes it hard to justify that a painting is genuinely that of aelbert cuyp; and finally, accurate identification is made extremely difficult by the fact that this same style was copied (rather accurately) by his predecessor. as it turns out, even the historians and expert researchers have been fooled and forced to reassess their conclusions over âcuypâsâ paintings over the years. ==later life== after he married cornelia boschman in 1658, the number of works produced by him declined almost to nothing. this may have been because his wife was a very religious woman and a not very big patron of the arts. it could also be that he became more active in the church under his wife's guidance. he was also active as deacon and elder of the reformed church. {{-}} [[file:aelbert cuyp - reclining dog, c. 1645 - google art project.jpg|thumb|''reclining dog'' (c. 1645), black chalk, gray wash, light-green watercolor, [[albertina]]]] ==conclusions== upon close examination of the works attributed to aelbert cuyp it is easily understood why his unique style developed the way it did, and how his works have been misinterpreted over the years. a lacking biography and weak chronology of works as well as his style which emerged from various influences makes his works distinctive, yet often questionable in determination. furthermore, his evolving technique and collaborations with his father add to the puzzle over which works should be attributed to cuyp. lastly and most importantly, the precision in mimicking cuypâs style by his follower abraham van calraet and their contentious signatures makes it all the more difficult to determine which paintings are genuinely that of cuyp and which ones are actually accurate reproductions in his style. such a thin chronology and little background knowledge has led to gross misinterpretations of his works, and thus further investigation must always be done to conclude with confidence that aelbert cuyp is the genuine source of such great paintings. it is this felt reluctance which led the rijksmuseum to reattribute works to other painters (abraham van calraet does not even appear in a museum catalogue until 1926, and even then he is not given his own entry)riemsdijk, (1926), p. 47. which shows how important it is to art historians that painters are accurately connected to their worksâand this is continuously necessary for those of aelbert cuyp, as dordrechtâs most famous painter may not in fact be dordrechtâs most famous painter. ==references== {{ibid|date=september 2012}} {{commons category|aelbert cuyp}} {{cite journal |last = cole |first = timothy |title = old dutch masters. aelbert cuyp |journal = [[century magazine]] |volume = 48 |issue = 1 |year = 1894 |url = http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/century_magazine/volume_48/issue_1/old_dutch_masters._aelbert_cuyp |accessdate = 2007-04-14 }} {{cite web |title = aelbert cuyp |work = the vincent van gogh gallery |url = http://www.vangoghgallery.com/artistbios/aelbert_cuyp.html |accessdate = 2007-04-14 }} {{cite web |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/wm/paint/auth/cuyp/ |title = cuyp |last = pioch |first = nicholas |date = 2002-07-14 |work = webmuseum, paris |accessdate = 2007-04-19 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070429004954/http://ibiblio.org/wm/paint/auth/cuyp/| archivedate= 29 april 2007 | deadurl= no}} {{cite web |last = kelly |first = ned |title = cuyp cake |work = [[new statesman]] |date = 2002-03-18 |url = http://www.newstatesman.com/200203180037 |accessdate = 2007-04-19 }} {{cite web |last = |first = |title = aelbert cuyp |work = [[national gallery of art]] |year = 2007 |url = http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/2001/cuyp/life.htm |accessdate = 2007-10-25 }} ==external links== *[http://www.pubhist.com/person/112/aelbert-cuyp works and literature on aelbert cuyp] *[http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15324coll10/id/59153/rec/1 dutch and flemish paintings from the hermitage], an exhibition catalog from the metropolitan museum of art (fully available online as pdf), which contains material on cuyp (cat. no. 7) {{authority control|viaf=19949742}} {{persondata |name = cuyp, aelbert |alternative names = cuyp, aelbert jacobsz |short description = landscape painting |date of birth = october 20, 1620 |place of birth = [[dordrecht]] |date of death = november 15, 1691 |place of death = [[dordrecht]] }} {{defaultsort:cuyp, aelbert}}

in todayâs world it is an art of both sexes. most commonly the carvings of ivory and wood originated as part of making hunting weapons. other carvings depicted the animals of their world, which were so important: such as seals and whales. they also depicted humans.{{cite book|last=black|first=lydia|title=aleut art unangam aguqaadangin|year=2003|publisher=aleutian/pribilof islands association|location=anchorage, ak}} the aleut also carve walrus ivory for other uses, such as jewelry and sewing needles. jewelry is made with designs specific to the region of each people. each [[clan]] would have a specific style to signify their origin. jewelry ornaments were made for piercing lips (labrum), nose, and ears, as well as for necklaces. each woman had her own sewing needles, which she made, and that often had detailed end of animal heads. aleut [[basketry]] is some of the finest in the world. the tradition began in prehistoric times. the main method of basketry was false embroidery (overlay). strands of grasses or reeds were overlaid upon the basic weaving surface, to obtain a plastic effect. basketry was an art reserved for women. early aleut women created baskets and woven mats of exceptional technical quality, using only their thumbnail, grown long and then sharpened, as a tool. today, aleut weavers continue to produce woven grass pieces of a remarkable cloth-like texture, works of modern art with roots in ancient tradition. birch bark, puffin feathers, and baleen are also commonly used by the aleut in basketry. the aleut term for grass basket is ''qiigam aygaaxsii''. one aleut leader recognized by the state of alaska for her work in teaching and reviving aleut basketry was [[anfesia shapsnikoff]]. her life and accomplishments are portrayed in the book ''moments rightly placed''(1998).hudson, 1998 masks were created to portray figures of their myths and oral history. the [[atka people]] believed that another people lived in their land before them. they portrayed such ancients in their masks, which show anthropomorphic creatures named in their language. knut bergsland says their word means âlike those found in caves.â masks were generally carved from wood and were decorated with paints made from berries or other natural products. feathers were inserted into holes carved out for extra decoration. these masks were used in ceremonies ranging from dances to praises, each with its own meaning and purpose. ===tattoos and piercings=== the tattoos and piercings of the aleut people demonstrated accomplishments as well as their religious views. they believed their body art would please the spirits of the animals and make any evil go away. the body orifices were believed to be pathways for the entry of evil entities. by piercing their orifices: the nose, the mouth, and ears, they would stop evil entities, ''khoughkh'', from entering their bodies (osborn, 52). body art also enhanced their beauty, social status, and spiritual authority. before the 19th century, piercings and tattoos were very common among the aleut people, especially among women. piercings, such as the nose pin, were common among both men and women and were usually performed a few days after birth. the ornament was made of various materials, a piece of bark or bone, or an eagleâs feather shaft. from time to time, adult women decorated the nose pins by hanging pieces of amber and coral from strings on it; the semi-precious objects dangled down to their chins. piercing ears was also very common. the aleuts pierced holes around the rim of their ears with dentalium shells (tooth shells or tusk shells), bone, feathers, dried bird wings or skulls and/or amber. materials associated with birds were important, as birds were considered to defend animals in the spirit world. a male would wear sea lion whiskers in his ears as a trophy of his expertise as a hunter. worn for decorative reasons, and sometimes to signify social standing, reputation, and the age of the wearer, aleuts would pierce their lower lips with walrus ivory and wear beads or bones. the individual with the most piercings held the highest respect. tattooing for women began when they reached physical maturity, or menstruation, at about age 20. men traditionally received their first tattoo after killing their first animal, another rite of passage. sometimes tattoos signaled social class. for example, the daughter of a rich, famous ancestor or father would work hard at her tattoos to show the accomplishments of that ancestor or father. they would sew, or prick, different designs on the chin, the side of the face, or under the nose. the russians arrived in the aleutian islands in 1786 and were active there, with small trading settlements and religious missions, through the mid-19th century. they often enslaved the natives, forcing them to work for them. their influence disrupted aleut life, and many of the traditional customs disappeared.{{cite web|last=krutak|first=lars|title=tattooing and piercing among the alaskan aleut|url=http://www.larskrutak.com/articles/aleut/|accessdate=28 april 2011}} ===aleut clothing=== [[file:aleut sax.jpg|thumb|imitation of the ''sax'', a traditional aleut coat made from bird skins and sea otter fur.]] [[file:parka (kamleika) aleutian islands.jpg|thumb|a [[kamleika]], or seal skin coat]] the aleut people developed in one of the harshest climates in the world, and learned to create and protect warmth. both men and women wore parkas that extended below the knees. the women wore the skin of seal or sea-otter, and the men wore bird skin parkas, the feathers turned in or out depending on the weather. when the men were hunting on the water, they wore waterproof parkas made from seal or sea-lion guts, or the entrails of bear, walrus, or whales. parkas had a hood that could be cinched, as could the wrist openings, so water could not get in. men wore breeches made from the esophageal skin of seals. children wore parkas made of downy eagle skin with tanned bird skin caps.''enthnohistory'': gross &amp; khera pg. 33, 34 they called these parkas ''kameikas,'' meaning raingear in the english language.(aleut corp. web.). sea-lions, harbor seals, and the sea otters are the most abundant marine mammals. the men brought home the skins and prepared them by soaking them in urine and stretching them. the women undertook the sewing (''enthnohistory:'' gross &amp; khera pg. 32). preparation of the gut for clothing involved several steps. the prepared intestines were turned inside out. a bone knife was used to remove the muscle tissue and fat from the walls of the intestine. the gut was cut and stretched, and fastened to stakes to dry. it was then cut and sewn to make waterproof parkas, bags, and other receptacles (turner, ch. 5, pg. 70). on some hunting trips, the men would take several women with them. they would catch birds and prepare the carcasses and feathers for future use. they caught puffins, lunda cirrhata, fratercula corniculata, guillemots, and cephus &amp; murres.lucien m. turner, pg. 70 it took 40 skins of tufted puffin and 60 skins of horned puffin to make one parka. a woman would need a year for all the labor to make one parka. each lasted two years with proper care. all parkas were decorated with bird feathers, beard bristles of seal and sea-lion, beaks of sea parrots, bird claws, sea otter fur, dyed leather, and caribou hair sewn in the seams. (gross &amp; khera, pg. 34). women made needles from the wingbones of seabirds. they made thread from the sinews of different animals and fish guts.gross &amp; khera pg. 33 a thin strip of seal intestine could also be used, twisted to form a thread. the women grew their thumbnail extra long and sharpened it. they could split threads to make them as fine as a hair.turner, pg. 71. they used vermilion paint, hematite, the ink bag of the octopus, and the root of a kind of grass or vine to color the threads.turner, ch. 5, pg. 71 ===hunting technologies=== ====boats==== {{main|aleutian kayak}} [[file:choris, saint paul.jpg|thumb|left|illustration of an aleut paddling a baidarka, with an anchored russian ship in the background, near [[saint paul island (alaska)|saint paul island]], by louis choris, 1817]] the interior regions of the rough, mountainous aleutian islands provided little in terms of natural resources for the aleutian people. they collected stones for weapons, tools, stoves or lamps. they collected and dried grasses for their woven baskets. for everything else, the aleuts had learned to use the fish and mammals they caught and processed to satisfy their needs.{{cite book|last=antonson|first=joan|title=alaska's heritage|year=1984|publisher=the alaska historical commission|location=anchorage|pages=85â95}} in order to hunt sea mammals and to travel between islands, the aleuts became experts of sailing and navigation. while hunting, they used small watercraft called ''[[aleutian kayak|baidarkas]].'' for regular travel, they used their large baidaras. [[file:rowing baidara st george is line1700.jpg|thumb|a man rowing a baidara (large skin boat)]] the baidara was a large, open, walrus-skin-covered boat. aleut families used it when traveling among the islands. it was also used to transport goods for trade, and warriors took them to battle.{{cite book|last=durham|first=bill|title=canoes and kayaks of western america|year=1960|publisher=copper canoe press|location=seattle|pages=11â20}} the baidarka (small skin boat) was a small boat covered in sea lion skin. it was developed and used for hunting because of its sturdiness and maneuverability. the aleut baidarka resembles that of a [[yupik peoples|yup'ik]] [[kayak]], but it is aerodynamically sleeker and faster. they made the baidarka for one or two persons only. the deck was made with a sturdy chamber, the sides of the craft were nearly vertical and the bottom was rounded. most one-man baidarkas were about {{convert|16|ft|m}} feet long and {{convert|20|in|cm}} wide, whereas a two-man was on average about {{convert|20|ft|m}} long and {{convert|24|in|cm}} wide. it was from the baidarka that aleut men would stand on the water to hunt from the sea. ====weapons==== the aleuts hunted small sea mammals with barbed darts and harpoons slung from throwing boards. these boards gave precision as well as some extra distance to these weapons.{{cite book|last=jochelson|first=waldemar|title=archaeological investigations in the aleutian islands|year=1925|publisher=university of utah press|location=salt lake city|page=145}} harpoons were also called throwing-arrows when the pointed head fit loosely into the socket of the foreshaft and the head was able to detach from the harpoon when it penetrated an animal, and remain in the wound. there were three main kinds of harpoon that the aleutâs used: a simple harpoon, with a head that kept its original position in the animal after striking, a compound (toggle-head) harpoon in which the head took a horizontal position in the animal after penetration, and the throwing-lance used to kill large animals. the simple aleut harpoon consisted of four main parts: the wooden shaft, the bone foreshaft, and the bonehead (tip) with barbs pointed backward. the barbed head was loosely fitted into the socket of the foreshaft so that when the animal was stabbed, it pulled the head away from the rest of the harpoon. the sharp barbs penetrated with ease, but could not be pulled out. the bone tip is fastened to a length of braided twine meanwhile; the hunter held the other end of the twine in his hand. the compound harpoon was the most prevalent weapon of the aleut people. also known as the toggle-head spear, it was about the same size as the simple harpoon and used to hunt the same animals, however, this harpoon provided a more efficient and lethal weapon. this harpoon separated into four parts. the longest part was the shaft with the thicker stalk closer to the tip of the harpoon. the shaft was fitted into the socket of the fore shaft and a bone ring was then placed over the joint to hold the two pieces together, as well as, protecting the wooden shaft from splitting. connected to the fore shaft of the harpoon is the toggle head spear tip. this tip was made of two sub shafts that break apart on impact with an animal. the upper sub shaft held the razor stone head and attached to the lower sub shaft with a small braided twine loop. once the tip penetrates the animal the upper sub head broke off from the rest of the shaft, however, since it was still connected with the braided loop it rotated the head into a horizontal position inside the animalâs body so that it could not get away from the hunter. the throwing-lance may be distinguished from a harpoon because of the fact that all its pieces are fixed and immovable. a lance is formerly a weapon of war and it was also used to kill large marine animals after it has already been harpooned. the throwing lance usually consisted of three parts: a wooden shaft, a bone ring or belt, and the compound head that was made with a barbed bonehead and a stone tip. the length of the compound head was equivalent to the distance between the planes of a manâs chest to his back. the lance would penetrate the chest and pass through the chest cavity and exit from the back. the bone ring was designed to break after impact so that the shaft could be used again for another kill. ===burial practices=== [[archeologists]] have found many different types of burials, dating from a variety of periods, in the aleutian islands. the aleut developed a style of burials that were accommodated to local conditions, and honored the dead. they have had four main types of burials: ''umqan'', cave, above-ground sarcophagi, and burials connected to communal houses. umqan burials are the most widely known type of mortuary practice found in the aleutian islands. the people created burial mounds, that tend to be located on the edge of a bluff.veltre 2001 they placed stone and earth over the mound to protect and mark it. such mounds were first excavated by archeologists in 1972 on southwestern unmak island, and dated to the early contact period. researchers have found a prevalence of these umqan burials, and concluded it is a regional mortuary practice. it may be considered a pan-aleutian mortuary practice. cave burials have been found throughout the eastern aleutian islands. the human remains are buried in shallow graves at the rear of the cave.west et al. 2003 these caves tend to be located next to [[middens]] and near villages.nelson and barnett 1955 some [[grave goods]] have been found in the caves associated with such burials. for example, a deconstructed boat was found in a burial cave on kanaga island. there were no other major finds of grave goods in the vicinity. throughout the aleutian islands, gravesites have been found that are above-ground [[sarcophagi]]. these sarcophagi are left exposed, with no attempt to bury the dead in the ground.corbett 2001 these burials tend to be isolated and limited to the remains of adult males, which may indicate a specific ritual practice. in the near islands, isolated graves have also been found with the remains, and not just the sarcophagus, left exposed on the surface. this way of erecting sarcophagi above ground is not as common as umqan and cave burials, but it is still widespread. another type of practice has been to bury remains in areas next to the communal houses of the settlement. human remains are abundant in such sites. they indicate a pattern of burying the dead within the main activity areas of the settlement. these burials consist of small pits adjacent to the houses and scattered around them. in these instances, mass graves are common for women and children. this type of mortuary practice has been mainly found in the near islands. in addition to these four main types, other kinds of burials have been found in the aleutian islands. these more isolated examples include [[mummification]], private burial houses, abandoned houses, etc. to date, such examples are not considered to be part of a larger, unifying tradition. the findings discussed represent only the sites that have been excavated. the variety of mortuary practices mostly did not included the ritual of including extensive grave goods, as has been found in other cultures. the remains so far have been mainly found with other human and faunal remains. the addition of objects to &quot;accompany&quot; the dead is rare. archaeologists have been trying to dissect the absence of a great tradition of grave goods, but findings have been ambiguous and do not really help the academic community to understand these practices more. not much information is known about the ritual parts of burying the dead. archeologists and anthropologists have not found much evidence related to burial rituals. this lack of ritual evidence could hint at either no ritualized ceremony, or one that has not yet been revealed in the archaeological record. as a result, archaeologists cannot decipher the context to understand exactly why a certain type of burial was used in particular cases. ==notable aleut== * [[benny benson]] (russian-aleut-swedish), designer of the [[flag of alaska]] * [[john hoover (artist)|john hoover]] (1919â2011), sculptor * [[carl e. moses]] (1929-2014) businessman, state representative, who served from 1965â1973 as both a republican and democrat, * [[cungagnaq]] (st.
